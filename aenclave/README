Audio Enclave Install Instructions:


First, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- Django (>= 1.0)
- GStreamer (>= 0.10; this includes gstreamer-plugins-base/good/ugly)
- pygst (spelled 'python-gst' by Ubuntu/Debian)
- Pyro (python remote objects)
- cjson (spelled 'python-cjson' by Ubuntu/Debian)
- A database that Django supports.  To start, we recommend sqlite3 because it
  does not require a daemon running in the background.

Next, copy settings.py.tmpl to settings.py.  Edit settings.py and supply values
for all variables tagged with 'CUSTOMIZE ME'.  More info on the Django specific
settings and this process in general can be found on the Django web site.

Run the manage.py script in the project root like so:
  python manage.py syncdb
This will populate the database that you just configured with the model tables
and a default channel.

For development, you should use Django's own HTTP server, but for production
you now need to configure Apache/mod_python for the aenclave Django project.
To run the Django server, run the management script with the argument
'runserver'.  You should be able to go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and see
the Django admin page without any errors now.

The last step is to configure the audio enclave player daemon to start on boot.
If you are on Ubuntu/Debian, do the following:
  sudo cp MENCLAVE/aenclave/gst_player/ae-player-init.sh /etc/init.d/ae-player
  sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/ae-player
  # Edit the vars labelled 'CUSTOMIZE ME'
  sudo vi /etc/init.d/ae-player
  sudo update-rc.d ae-player defaults
  # Start the player now.
  sudo /etc/init.d/ae-player start
If you are using another distro, there should be similar mechanisms in place for
your distro.

To test that everything worked, click 'Upload', upload a song, and queue it by
clicking the link.  If playback does not start, look for tracebacks in both the
Django server process and the gst_server process to try and diagnose the
problem.

To make SFTP uploading work, you should run an SFTP server on the same host as
the gst_player process.  TODO(rnk): Document this process more thoroughly.
