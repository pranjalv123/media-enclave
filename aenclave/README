Audio Enclave Install Instructions:


First, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- Django (>= 1.0)
- GStreamer (>= 0.10; this includes gstreamer-plugins-base/good/ugly)
- pygst (spelled 'python-gst' by Ubuntu/Debian)
- Pyro (python remote objects)
- cjson (spelled 'python-cjson' by Ubuntu/Debian)
- A database that Django supports.  To start, we recommend sqlite3 because it
  does not require a daemon running in the background.

Next, copy settings.py.tmpl to settings.py.  Edit settings.py and supply values
for all variables tagged with 'CUSTOMIZE ME'.  More info on the Django specific
settings and this process in general can be found on the Django web site.

Run the manage.py script in the project root like so:
  python manage.py syncdb
This will populate the database that you just configured with the model tables
and a default channel.

For development, you should use Django's own HTTP server, but for production
you now need to configure Apache/mod_python for the aenclave Django project.
To run the Django server, run the management script with the argument
'runserver'.  You should be able to go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and see
the Django admin page without any errors now.

The last thing we need to do is to run aenclave/gst_player/gst_server.py.  Make
sure the project root is in your PYTHONPATH and that Pyro is installed, or you
will get errors at this step.

To test that everything worked, click 'Upload', upload a song, and queue it by
clicking the link.  If playback does not start, look for tracebacks in both the
Django server process and the gst_server process to try and diagnose the
problem.
